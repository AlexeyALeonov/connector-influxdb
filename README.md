* Store both these files in a `config` folder. Sample files are already provided. Make respective changes and you are good to go. Filename command-line arguments are optional. Defualt locations are used.

## Description
* Overview
	* Storj-IndluxDB Connector connects to the user IndluxDB database using the credentials provided by them in the database configuration file, takes backup of the specified database and uploads the backup files on Storj network inside the path specified by the user in the Storj configutation file.
* User can choose from the following commands:
	* `Parse`:- This command works as follows:
		* Connect to the specidifed database using the user specified creadentions in the database configuration file(db_property).
		* Take backup of the database using a "backup" command provided by influxdb.
		* Read those backup files and store their contents inside a byte array and notify the user of successful read.
		* Print the size of the byte array if "debug" is provided as argument.
	* `Test`:- This command works as follows:
		* Connect to storj network.
		* Upload sample data to storj network inside the path specidifed by the user in the Storj configuration file(storj_config).
		* Download the sample data uploaded on Storj network on local disk if "debug" is provided as argument.
		* Generate a restricted serialized scope key if "restrict" is provided as argument.
	* `Store`:- This command works as follows:
		* Connect to the specidifed database using the user specified creadentions in the database configuration file(db_property).
		* Take backup of the database using a "backup" command provided by influxdb.
		* Connect to storj network.
		* Iterate through the backup files and upload each file in parts of buffer size 32KB to Storj network.
		* Download the backup files uploaded to Storj network same as the original backup files if "debug" is provided as argument.
		* Generate a restricted serialized scope key if restrict is provided as argument.

## Build Once
* To build the project, run the following command:
```
$ go build storj-influxdb.go
```
* or you cam simply run:
```
go build
```

**NOTE**: Please make sure Influxd server is running in order to connect to database successfully.

## Run the command-line tool

```
$ ./storj-influxdb -h
```
